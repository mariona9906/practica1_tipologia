The volume-regulated anion channel LRRC8C suppresses T cell function by regulating cyclic dinucleotide transport and STING–p53 signaling,"Concepcion et al. show that the volume-regulated anion channel LRRC8C mediates the transport of cGAMP in T cells, resulting in a noncanonical STING–p53-dependent suppression of Ca2+ influx, T cell proliferation and cytokine production.",Axel R.

IFNγ and GM-CSF control complementary differentiation programs in the monocyte-to-phagocyte transition during neuroinflammation,"Becher and colleagues use a mouse model of multiple sclerosis to show that IFNγ is essential for the acquisition of a mature inflammatory phagocyte phenotype, while GM-CSF is required for phagocytosis and the production of IL-1β and ROS in Ly6Chi monocytes during neuroinflammation.",Ana AmorimDonatella De FeoBurkhard Becher,31 Jan 2022,Payed Access,https://media.springernature.com/w290h158/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41590-021-01117-7/MediaObjects/41590_2021_1117_Fig1_HTML.png,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01117-7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Group 3 innate lymphoid cells produce the growth factor HB-EGF to protect the intestine from TNF-mediated inflammation,TNF is an important driver of many inflammatory diseases. Zhou et al. demonstrate ILC3 production of the growth factor HB-EGF protects against TNF-mediated injury of the gut epithelium in inflammatory bowel disease.,Lei ZhouWenqing ZhouGregory F.

Recruitment and activation of type 3 innate lymphoid cells promote antitumor immune responses,The function of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in cancer is still poorly understood. Bruchard et al. demonstrate that ILC3s are critical for the recruitment of T cells to the tumor microenvironment and thereby play important roles in antitumor responses.,Mélanie BruchardMannon GeindreauFrançois Ghiringhelli,31 Jan 2022,Payed Access,https://media.springernature.com/w290h158/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41590-021-01120-y/MediaObjects/41590_2021_1120_Fig1_HTML.png,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01120-y,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
Recognition and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by humoral innate immunity pattern recognition molecules,"Stravalaci et al. examined recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by human soluble innate pattern recognition receptor. They report that pentraxin 3 and mannose-binding protein recognize viral nucleoprotein and spike, respectively. Mannose-binding lectin has antiviral activity, and human genetic polymorphisms of MBL2 are associated with more severe COVID-19.",Matteo StravalaciIsabel PaganiCecilia Garlanda,31 Jan 2022,Payed Access,https://media.springernature.com/w290h158/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41590-021-01114-w/MediaObjects/41590_2021_1114_Fig1_HTML.png,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01114-w,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Neuropilin-1 mediates lung tissue-specific control of ILC2 function in type 2 immunity,"ILC2s are heterogeneous, dependent on tissue location. Here the authors show that TGFβ-induced neuropilin-1 specifically marks lung ILC2s and controls their function in pulmonary fibrosis by inducing expression of the ST2 IL-33 receptor.",Jingjing ZhangJinxin QiuLei Shen,24 Jan 2022,Payed Access,https://media.springernature.com/w290h158/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41590-021-01097-8/MediaObjects/41590_2021_1097_Fig1_HTML.png,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01097-8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
